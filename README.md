token_entity_widget
===================

This module is an alternative to the [token_insert_entity](https://www.drupal.org/project/token_insert_entity) module.
Rather than search for the title of the node, you add the node via the [inline_entity_form](https://www.drupal.org/project/inline_entity_form). 
This module then allows you to choose which viewmode you would like to display the node and generates an embedable token that
you can then place anywhere in body of the parent node.
